jEdit mode for freeform RPG IV

I use [jEdit editor](http://jedit.org) as a remote editor to develop freeform [RPG IV](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzasd/sc092508.pdf)
code (UTF-8) on the IBM i in the Integrated File System (IFS) via the jEdit FTP Plugin.

This project provides a (minimal, so far) jEdit edit mode for RPG IV intended for that environment.

* Currently does not support old-style control specs. 
* Recognizes keywords but is indiscriminate in highlighting about anything starting with `*` or anything that looks like a function.


Much more could be done, feel free to fork for pull request, I'd be glad for the help!
